# Documentation

Currently, there is no technical documentation. However I created list of PRDs : https://eantz.notion.site/Church-Management-System-193d15af53168045b01aff0a6c194bfc?pvs=4. It's not a perfect PRD, but it certainly helps me to implement the features.
I will update it regularly before create a new feature. And it will help you understand how the features work.

# Attention Please

Hallelio is not in production ready. I'm still developing other basic features. If you have any suggestion, please create an issue.
